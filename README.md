DriverPass is a company that would like a system to help students train for and pass their driving test.  The system would allow the students to choose from a number pre-prepared packages, access training material from their selected package, and if part of their package schedule driving lessons with a trainer.
In this project, I did particularly well with determining the requirements for the system.  They included functional and non-functional requirements.
If I could choose one part of my work to revise, I would spend a bit more time working on the UML models.  I used LucidChart to create the models and there was a definite learning curve.  I feel that I would do better on the initial models with the more experience I have now.
I interpreted the user's needs and implemented them into my design by knowing what DriverPass was trying to accomplish and what their employees and customers would need from the system in order to accomplish those requirements.  It's important to consider the user's needs in the design because if the system isn't compatible with the user, they will look for another system that is compatible.
I feel that the best approach to designing software is to communicate with everyone involved from the customers to the executives to come up with a complete set of requirements and analyze those requirements to come up with a complete design for a system.
